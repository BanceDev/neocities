          For security reasons, we cannot reset your password if you don't have control of your email address, because there is no way to know if you're the legitimate owner or an attacker. You will have to make a new site (don’t worry, it’s free!). If you didn’t get an email from the password reset form, check your spam folder.

            Absolutely! Neocities is not opposed to you making money from your web site. We won't put ads on your site, but you are welcome to put ads on your own site if you want to, as long as that isn't the only use of your site (sites that only contain ads are considered spam and violate our ToS). You are also welcome to sell items, or put your business page on Neocities.

            Neocities intentionally only provides static hosting (such as HTML, CSS, JS). As such, we cannot provide access to any "back-end" programming languages. We feel that creating sites that use these languages tend to become obsolete quickly (programming languages don't stay around for very long), and that sites are best created without them unless they are complicated web applications. Also, allowing programming languages on the backend would make it much harder for us to run Neocities, for both monetary and security reasons.
          </p>

          <p>
            Front-end programming with Javascript, however, is allowed and highly encouraged!

            <strong>Hits</strong> are number of requests for any file on a site, <strong>views</strong> count for one unique IP address per hour. Views provide better insight into how many individuals (or search engines, etc) are looking at your site. There is no such thing as perfectly accurate stats, so this doesn't necessarily reflect how many actual people are viewing your site, but it does provide a rough way to see how popular your site is becoming. If you put a hit counter on your site, it may give a different number than what Neocities records and that is expected.
          </p>

          <p>We don't provide a way to look at individual visitor records on Neocities, the main reason being that the information isn't very useful anymore, since most sources block HTTP Referer headers, making it difficult to determine origin.</p>

            We don't support FTP, apologies! Aside from security problems with FTP, it isn't used by many people anymore. We need to stay focused on what we work on, so we only support ways to upload content that most people use these days.

            Neocities intentionally does not provide any embeddable code for use within Neocities sites, because we don't want sites to become dependent on Neocities services to work. We like the idea of making static sites that last a long time, and these sorts of services tend to fade away, causing your site to stop working.
          </p>

          <p>
            We do provide services for the sites on the main site (neocities.org), such as a site profile and tagging so you can form communities of sites with similar interests. We think that's a better way to do it than to push our way into your site. You can of course link to your Neocities Site Profile (https://neocities.org/site/yourusername) from your own site if you'd like.

            Neocities does not have a policy of transferring inactive sites to different owners and can't make manual exceptions at the moment. This is a tricky subject because we don't have a way to be sure if a user has actually abandoned their site, even if it's just the default "new site" template. We may have a different policy in the future regarding this.

            We don't currently support certain types of files, particularly multimedia files and WebASM with free sites because of persistent issues with abuse (piracy, bitcoin mining, excessive bandwidth usage). In general, these files are not conducive to Neocities' mission of bringing back personal home pages vs being a piracy and webapp hosting platform. You can embed audio and videos through other providers like YouTube, which is preferred because they will automatically provide the streaming media in formats that work better for your specific users' devices (such as mobile phones).

            standards and old browser standards, allowing for us to provide the speed and security of the new web without compromising the ability to use old browsers.

          <p>
            The .htaccess file is an Apache specific thing, and we don't use Apache for our backend. In addition, we generally don't add features to Neocities that make the functionality of sites depend on custom backend functionality (the sole exception being that we make sure "page not found" goes to "not_found.html" so you can create a custom 404.)
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, we sometimes see people trying to use .htaccess for authentication (with usernames and passwords). Neocities is only for sites and information you want to make public, and it is dangerous to use it for private sites! We make backups of your site and attackers can easily find any information you're trying to hide using our archivers. Our goal is to make sure your sites stay up for a long time and persist, not to enforce secrecy zones on your site. If you want to make a controlled access site, Neocities is not for you.
